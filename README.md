# CSS3 VHS Glitch Effect
**[The Demo](http://dulnan.net/vhs)**
Only works with Chrome. Oh and you need a fast machine.
Using CSS filters and animations, no JavaScript.

## why
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

## How to compile
Install all the dependencies with `npm install` and then compile using `gulp`.

## Files and folders
The *demo* folder contains the minified css file and *vhs.html* where the stylesheet is embedded.
